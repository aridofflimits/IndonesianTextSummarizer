The model is optimized for the Indonesian language, having been fine-tuned on the 'id_liputan6' dataset. This dataset is comprised of text summarization data derived from Liputan6, a prominent Indonesian news website. The ultimate goal of this project is to deliver succinct and accurate summaries of Indonesian news articles.
